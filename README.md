# Friends-Binger
Python app which starts a random episode of 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S.'

There's nothing quite like sitting back and watching an episode of Friends after a long and tiring day. But it's hard to choose an episode
when each and every one is so good. This is why I built this little piece of awesomeness which will fire up a random episode every time.
It is built on Python and uses only the core modules.

In case you wish to use this, you'll have to modify the path to your library and make sure your files are consistently named.
The code currently uses the glob module to insert the episode title of the episode since my files are named like this:

Friends - 4x12 - The One With The Embryos.mkv


Things I wish to add to this:
- A recents list which gets scanned everytime so that an episode which you recently watched isn't repeated.
- A GUI.
- Better support for reading filenames.

PS: I did this project in an effort to learn and get familiar Python, not because this stupid app needed to be made!
