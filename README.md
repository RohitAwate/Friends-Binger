# F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Binger
A tiny Python app which starts a random episode of 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S.'

There's nothing quite like sitting back and watching an episode of Friends after a long and tiring day. But it's hard to choose an episode
when each and every one is so good. This is why I built this little piece of awesomeness which will fire up a random episode every time.

# Usage
You'll have to modify the path to your library and make sure your files are consistently named (I recommend [FileBot](https://www.filebot.net/)). All your episodes should look like this:

`Friends - 4x12 - The One With The Embryos.mkv`

_Happy binging!_
